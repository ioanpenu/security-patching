âœ… How to Use It

    Save it as generate-vaults.sh

    Make it executable:

chmod +x generate-vaults.sh

Create your Ansible Vault password file (if not done already):

echo 'YourVaultPassword' > ~/.vault_pass.txt
chmod 600 ~/.vault_pass.txt

Run the script:

    ./generate-vaults.sh

You'll be prompted to enter hostnames and sudo passwords one by one. The script encrypts each password into its own host's vault.yml.
ðŸ’¡ Example Interaction:

Enter hostnames (space-separated): server1.local server2.local
Enter sudo password for server1.local: ********
Vault created for server1.local at host_vars/server1.local/vault.yml
Enter sudo password for server2.local: ********
Vault created for server2.local at host_vars/server2.local/vault.yml
